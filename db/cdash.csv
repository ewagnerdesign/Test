If subject has provided written authorization
(i.e., informed consent) for the reporting of

reporting of a full and accurate date of birth
appropriate. This approach is generally
consistent with the privacy laws of most
countries.
See the Additional Information for
Sponsors for each of the temporal
components (rows 1a-1d) below.
Below are some examples of complete and
reduced precision when recording date of
birth:
• Subjects without birth records might only
be able to provide their date of birth to the
decade level (reduced precision -
imputation may be needed for analyses).
• Subjects in countries where privacy rules
preclude the collection of personal data
containing more detail than the year of
birth might only provide date of birth data
to the year level (reduced precision -
imputation may be needed for analyses).
Note: It is recommended that the CRF
should be modified for sites in these
counties to prevent the clinician from
entering the data that would violate the
privacy rule (i.e., gray out the month and
day fields on paper or make them
inaccessible for entry in an EDC system). • Subjects in most studies would provide
date of birth data to the day level of
precision. This would provide the
expected level of detail to perform agerelated
analyses (expected precision for
analyses requirements).
• In studies where the analyses would
require more precise knowledge of age,
such as pediatric, natal or neo-natal
studies, it would be necessary to collect
date of birth data to the hour level, even in
countries with privacy constraints
(expected precision for analyses
requirements). Note: Appropriate written
authorization from parent or guardian (i.e.,
informed consent) as well as IAB and
DPA (Data Protection Authority)
approvals may be required in these cases.
It is expected that what is collected for
BRTHDAT is reported for the SDTM

are collected In a manner resulting in one of
the reduced precision levels noted above,
then the reported AGE (SDTM required

surgery.
Instruction examples:
Use the (sponsor-defined) code list to group the past and / or concomitant medical conditions or surgeries. For example, if the subject has a history of high blood pressure, use code “123” for “cardiovascular”.

CRF, entry screen or completion instructions. The reviewers expect this
information to be stored in MHBODSYS. Finally, the sponsor may only wish to
inquire about particular groupings or specific diseases; not actual body
