Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. NOTE: These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase I studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.

C35481;C71150;;ECG Result;ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA;ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA;Atrial tachycardia;Any rapid heart rhythm originating in the atria. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are varieties of atrial tachycardia. Atrial tachycardia is an electrical circuit originating in the upper or atrial chambers. This electrical circuit or focus takes over and generates rapid impulses across the atrial chambers. These impulses are transmitted to the ventricular chambers resulting in a rapid rate. These arrhythmias may originate from a variety of places across the atria. They may exist as an isolated problem or be related to an ongoing structural problem within the heart.

In left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) the posteroinferior regions of the left ventricular endocardium are activated abnormally before the anterosuperior left ventricular area. After emerging from the posteroinferior division of the left bundle branch, the impulse first propagates in an inferior, rightward, and usually anterior direction for a short period of time.
